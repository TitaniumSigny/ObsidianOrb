Obsidian Orb project
====================

Intro
-----

This is a project made as part of a Codecademy course, the "Mixed Messages" excercise.
It is to be sort of like a virtual magic eight ball -- a orb made of pure ether that summons messages from the swirling mists of cyberspace.

Requirements
------------

_Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output._

_the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data._

This will be interpreted to mean that each message will [pseudo]randomly pull an entry from each of three different arrays, and these will be combined to form an output message.

_Build a message generator program using JavaScript_

Satisfied by coding in JS

_Use Git version control_
_Use command line_
_Develop locally on your computer_

Git Bash was used to create a Git repo for the project, and to create this file.

Technologies
------------

Javascript
Node.js
Git
Git Bash

developed in Atom
